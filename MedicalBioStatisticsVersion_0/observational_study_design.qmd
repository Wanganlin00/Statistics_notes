## **PICOT Framework**

The PICOT framework helps to structure a specific and clear research question by focusing on five key elements:

| Element | Description                                                                           | Example                               |
|:--------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------|
| P       | Population of Interest: Who is the target group you are studying?                     | US adults                             |
| I       | Intervention: What is the main action, treatment, or variable you're looking at?      | Effect of having rheumatoid arthritis |
| C       | Comparison: Are you comparing the intervention against a control group or usual care? | People without rheumatoid arthritis   |
| O       | Outcome of Interest: What specifically do you want to measure?                        | Rate of cardiovascular diseases       |
| T       | Time Frame: Over what time period will your study take place?                         | 1999–2018                             |

## **FINER Criteria**

Once we have formulated your research question with the help of the PICOT elements, we should evaluate it using the FINER criteria:

| Element | Description                                                                             |
|:--------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| F       | Feasible: Is it possible to conduct this research with available resources?             |
| I       | Interesting: Is the research question intriguing to the scientific community?           |
| N       | Novel: Is the question original and not already thoroughly researched?                  |
| E       | Ethical: Is the research ethically sound?                                               |
| R       | Relevant: Is the research currently needed or will it fill a gap in existing knowledge? |
